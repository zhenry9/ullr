Connecting multiple timers to Ski Club
======================================
What if we're using a program like Split Second's Ski Club that only supports 
connecting one timing device? What if we want to use 3 or more timing devices to 
add wireless split times? Ullr can make it happen. This section expands on the 
previous section, :ref:`Wireless ski race timing`.
