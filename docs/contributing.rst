Contributing to Ullr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Contributions to Ullr are welcome and encouraged! The backbone of the project is 
written in Python, but there is a fair amount of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS 
required by the web interface.

Not a coder? This documentation could use some work! Adding detail and clarity, 
or explaining a unique use case is much appreciated.

Ullr is Developed on Github
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as 
accept pull requests. See the :xref:`github repo`.

Use `Github Flow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html>`_, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Pull requests are actively welcomed!

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPL v3 license.

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be 
under the same `MIT License <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/>`_ that 
covers the project.

Report bugs using Github's `issues <https://github.com/zhenry9/ullr/issues>`_

Ullr uses GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!
